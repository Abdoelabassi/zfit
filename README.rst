The zfit structure is based on the framework developed by Anton Poluektov using the TensorFlow (TF) open source library https://gitlab.cern.ch/poluekt/TensorFlowAnalysis

The authors would like to thank numerous invaluable inputs from the theory community, i.e., D. van Dyk, G. Isidori, members of LHCb collaboration, as well as from the Scikit-HEP community.
