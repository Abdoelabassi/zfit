zfit has been developed with support from the University of ZÃ¼rich and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) under contracs 168169 and 174182.

The zfit structure is based on the framework developed by Anton Poluektov using the TensorFlow (TF) open source library https://gitlab.cern.ch/poluekt/TensorFlowAnalysis

The authors would like to thank numerous invaluable inputs from the theory community, i.e., D. van Dyk, G. Isidori, members of LHCb collaboration, as well as from the Scikit-HEP community.
