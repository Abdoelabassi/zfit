minimizer.verbosity: |1+
 Verbosity of the minimizer. A value above 5 starts printing more
                 output with a value of 10 printing every evaluation of the loss function and gradient.
minimizer.tol: |1+
    Termination value for the convergence/stopping criterion of the algorithm
                    in order to determine if the minimum has been found. The default is 1e-3.
minimizer.criterion: |1+
    Termination value for the convergence/stopping criterion of the algorithm
                    in order to determine if the minimum has been found. The default is 1e-3.
minimizer.strategy: |1+
    Termination value for the convergence/stopping criterion of the algorithm
                    in order to determine if the minimum has been found. The default is 1e-3.
minimizer.maxiter: |1+
    Approximate number of iterations. This corresponds to roughly the maximum number of
                    evaluations of the `value`, 'gradient` or `hessian`.
minimizer.name: |1+
    Human readable name of the minimizer.
minimizer.maxcor: |1+
    Maximum number of memory history to keep when using a quasi-Newton update formula such as BFGS.
